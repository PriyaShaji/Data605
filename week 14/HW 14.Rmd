### Verify the formula given in the Key Idea by finding the first few terms of the Taylor series of the given function and identifying a pattern.

$f(x)=tan^{−1} (x); c=0$

<strong>Answer</strong>

Key Idea 32 of Section 8.8 states:

$\sum_{n=0}^{∞} (-1)^n x^{2n+1}/2n+1$

We need to find the derivatives for the first few n’s and evaluate them at x=0
to find a trend.

$f(x) = tan^{-1}(x),  f(0)=0$

$f'(x) = 1/x^{2}+1, f'(0)=1$

$f''(x) = -(2x/(x^2+1)^2), f''(0)=0$

$f'''(x) = -2(-3x^2+1/(x^2+1)^3), f'''(0)=-2$

$f''''(x) = 24x(-x^2+1/(x^2+1)^4), f''''(0)=0$

$f'''''(x)=24(5x^4-10x^2+1)/(x^2+1)^5, f'''''(0)=24$

$f''''''(x)=240x(-3x^4+10x^2-3)/(x^2+1)^6, f''''''(0)=0$

$f'''''''(x)=720(7x^6-35x^4+21x^2-1)/(x^2+1)^7, f'''''''(0)=-720$

Therefore, when we substitute this value into tylor's formula we get:

$tan^1(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{∞} (f^n(0) x^n/n!)$

$= 0x^0/0!+1x^1/1!+0x^2/2!-2x^3/3!+0x^4/4!+24x^5/5!+0x^6/6!-720x^7/7!+....$

$0+x^1/1+0-x^3/3+0+x^5/5+0-x^7/7+....$

$x^1/1-x^3/3+x^5/5-x^7/7$

$\sum_{n=0}^{∞}(-1)^n*x^{2n+1}/2n+1$

Therefore, it is verified.
