<strong>1. Use integration by substitution to solve the integral below.</strong>

$\int 4e^{-7x} dx$ 

<strong> Answer 1)</strong>

$z=−7x$

$dx=−17dz$

$4\int e^{z}-1/7 dz$ 

${-4/7} \int e^z dz$

${-4/7}e^z + C$

${-4/7}e^{-7x} + C$


<strong>2. Biologists are treating a pond contaminated with bacteria. The level of contamination is changing at a rate of
$\int dN/dt = -3150/t^4-220$ bacteria per cubic centimeter per day, where t is the number of days since treatment began. Find a function N( t ) to estimate the level of contamination if the level after 1 day was 6530 bacteria per cubic centimeter.</strong>

<strong> Answer 2)</strong>

$\int dN/dt = \int-3150/t^4-220 dt$

$= -12600/t^3 -220t+C$

Given, N(1)=6530 we can use this to find C

$N(1)=6530=-12600/1^3-220(1)+C$

$C=6290$

$N(1)=-12600/t^3-220t+6290$

<strong>3. Find the total area of the red rectangles in the figure below, where the equation of the line is f ( x ) = 2x - 9</strong>

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/priyashaji/Documents/cunymsds/Fall19/data 605/week 13/Screen Shot 2019-11-23 at 2.08.26 PM.png")
```

<strong> Answer 3)</strong>

$\int_{4.5}^{8.5} 2x-9x dx$

$x^2-9xdx|_{4.5}^{8.5}$

```{r}
((8.5)*(8.5)-(9*8.5))-((4.5)*(4.5)-(9*4.5))
```


Therefore, the total area of the red rectangles is 16.

<strong> 4. Find the area of the region bounded by the graphs of the given equations.
$y=x^2-2x-2$, $y=x+2$ Enter your answer below. </strong>

<strong> Answer 4)</strong>

To find the intersections:

$x+2=x^2−2x−2

$0=x2−3x−4$

$0=(x−4)(x+1)$

So the intersections occur at x=−1 and x=4

The area enclosed by these points has y=x+2 above the other equations. So to find the area:

$\int_{-1}^{4}x^2+2dx−\int_{-1}^{4}x^2−2x−2dx$

$=\int_{-1}^{4}−x^2+3x+4dx$

$=−x^3/3+3x^2/2+4x∣_{-1}^{4}$

$=−64/3+48/2+16−(−1/3+3/2−4)=−63/3+45/2+20$

$=−21+22.5+20$

$=21.5$


<strong>5. A beauty supply store expects to sell 110 flat irons during the next year. It costs $3.75 to store one flat iron for one year. There is a fixed cost of $8.25 for each order. Find the lot size and the number of orders per year that will minimize inventory costs.</strong>


<strong> Answer 5)</strong>


Let 
x be number of orders/year
y be lot size per order

then x * y - total number of irons ordered for the year

x*y >= 110, valid values for x are > = 1 as we need a minimum order of 1 per year to ship the inventory)

Cost of inventory per year = 3.75 (yx - 110) + 8.75x = 3.75yx + 8.75*x - 412.5

Our objective is to keep our cost of inventory per year at the minimum, we need to minimize x and maximize y. From the cost fucntion above, the mimumum value for x is 1 and since y = 110/x, y = 110.

By substitution, minimum cost is -

x is number of orders/year = 1
y is lot size per order = 110


```{r}
inventory_cost = 3.75 * ((110)*(1) - 110) + 8.75*(1)
inventory_cost

```



<strong>6. Use integration by parts to solve the integral below
$\int ln(9x) .x^6 dx$</strong>

<strong>6) Answer</strong>

We will be using integration by parts methods:


$∫u∗dv/dx∗dx = u*v - ∫v∗du/dx∗dx$

$u = ln(9x)$

du/dx, using chain rule -

$u = 9x d/du[ln u * d/dx(9x)] = 1/u* d/dx (9X) = 1/9x * 9$

$du/dx = 1/x$

$dv/dx = x^6$

$v = x^7/7$

$= ln (9x) * x^7/7 - ∫x^7/7∗1/x∗dx= x^7*(ln (9x)/7 - 1)$


<strong>7. Determine whether f ( x ) is a probability density function on the interval   [1, e**6 ]  . If not, determine the value of the definite integral.
$f(x)= 1 /6x$ </strong>

<strong> Answer 7)</strong>

$\int_{1}^{e^6} 1/(6x)$

$1/6 *ln x$ from $[1, e^6]$

```{r}
prob_density = (1/6) * log(exp(6)) - ((1/6) * log(1))
prob_density
```


f (x) is a probability density function on the interval $[1, e^6]$ - with the area of the curve as 1 (100% probabily for the interval)
